# Mood Map üß†üí¨

**Mood Map** is an interactive, web-based tool that lets users log and visualize their emotions in real time.

Inspired by a physical mood map created by the [Flourish Science team](https://www.myflourish.ai/mood-map) and the [circumplex model of affect](https://psu.pb.unizin.org/psych425/chapter/circumplex-models/), it maps feelings along two key psychological dimensions:  
- **Valence** (how pleasant or unpleasant an emotion feels)  
- **Arousal** (how energized or calm the emotion is)

Each user can place a dot anywhere on the 2D canvas to represent their current emotional state, optionally adding a label. Hovering/tapping reveals the label, and dots can be updated to reflect changing moods‚Äîencouraging emotional awareness and reflection.

## Why Mood Map?

Emotions are complex but not random. Decades of affective science show that most emotions can be organized along the **valence-arousal plane** (Russell, 1980). The Mood Map builds on this science to:

- Help users check in with their feelings in a structured yet flexible way  
- Enable groups (e.g., classrooms, teams) to visualize the collective emotional landscape  
- Offer a low-barrier entry into emotional tracking‚Äîno need to pick from predefined categories
